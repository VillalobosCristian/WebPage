# Flow Induced by Bacteria

The motion of bacteria is driven by the rotation of their flagella, which generates a hydrodynamic flow field around the cell. Due to the size of the microorganisms, the perturbed fluid around a microswimmer belongs to the limit of low Reynolds number $Re$. The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity that compares the magnitude of the inertial forces to the viscous forces. For a microswimmer, the Reynolds number can be estimated using the typical length of a bacterium $L = 1 \times 10^{-6}$ m, the velocity of the bacterium $U = 1 \times 10^{-5}$ m/s, and the kinematic viscosity of water $\nu = \eta/\rho = 1 \times 10^{-6}$ mÂ²/s, where $\eta$ and $\rho$ are the water viscosity and density. The Reynolds number is defined as:

$$
Re \equiv \frac{UL}{\nu} \approx 10^{-5}.
$$

This value is much smaller than the critical value of $Re \approx 1$ for nonlinear effects to perturb the fluid [[elgetiPhysicsMicroswimmersSingle2015]]. It is customary in this limit to set $Re = 0$, and the flow field $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{r}, t)$ produced by a bacterium is described by the [[Stokes Equation]] where inertia is neglected. The Stokes equation is:

$$
\nabla p = \eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{f},
\label{eq.Stokes}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure and $\mathbf{f}$ an external force per unit volume. The velocity field must satisfy the continuity equation $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$, which ensures conservation of mass. This linear equation is time-independent, which has profound consequences for the swimming mechanism of microswimmers to achieve directed motion [[purcell2014life]]. Purcell's scallop theorem states that a microswimmer must undergo a non-reciprocal motion to achieve net propulsion at low Reynolds numbers. A reciprocal motion, such as the opening and closing of a scallop shell, will not result in any net displacement in a time-reversible flow. Bacteria achieve non-reciprocal motion through the rotation of their flagella, which generates a helical wave that propels the cell forward [[nirodyBiophysicistGuideBacterial2017]].

## The Stokeslet
\label{sec:Stokeslet}

Let's consider the case where the force acts on a point in space $\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{F} \delta(\mathbf{x})$. The solution to the Stokes equation \eqref{eq.Stokes} for this case is known as the [[Stokeslet]]. The set of Stokes equations is then:

$$
\nabla p = \eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{F} \delta(\mathbf{x}),
\label{eq.Stokeslet}
$$

$$
0 = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u},
\label{eq.Continuity}
$$

Our goal is to find the velocity field $\mathbf{u}$ and the pressure field $p$ with the boundary condition $p \to p_{\infty}$ as $r = |\mathbf{x}| \to \infty$, and $\mathbf{u} \to \mathbf{u}_{\infty}$ as $r = |\mathbf{x}| \to \infty$. Without loss of generality, we can set $p_{\infty} = 0$ since the velocity field depends only on the pressure gradient [[zapryanov1999DynamicsBubblesDropsRigid]]. This is because the Stokes equation is invariant under a constant shift in pressure [[grahamMicrohydrodynamicsBrownianMotion2018]].

The solutions for the velocity and pressure fields can be obtained by taking the corresponding scalar products of $\mathbf{F}$ with the harmonic and biharmonic solutions, respectively (a detailed derivation is provided in the Appendix [[Stokeslet Derivation]]). The solutions are:

$$
\mathbf{u}_{\mathrm{Stokeslet}}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{8\pi\eta} \left( \frac{\mathbf{F}}{|\mathbf{x}|} + \frac{(\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \mathbf{x}}{|\mathbf{x}|^3} \right)
$$

$$
p(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{x}}{4\pi |\mathbf{x}|^3} = \frac{1}{4\pi} \mathbf{F} \cdot \nabla \left( \frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}|} \right).
$$

The [[Stokeslet]] solution represents the flow field generated by a point force in an unbounded fluid at low Reynolds numbers. The velocity field decays as $1/r$ with distance from the point force, while the pressure field decays as $1/r^2$. The [[Stokeslet]] solution forms the basis for modeling the hydrodynamic interactions between swimming microorganisms and their environment.

## The Dipole
\label{sec:Dipole}

The [[Oseen Tensor]] can be defined from the [[Stokeslet]] solution as the Green's function for the Stokes equation. It relates the velocity field at a point $\mathbf{x}$ to a point force applied at a point $\mathbf{y}$. From Eq. \eqref{eq.Stokeslet_velocity}, we can write the [[Oseen Tensor]] as:

$$
\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \frac{1}{8\pi\eta} \left( \frac{\mathbf{I}}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}|} + \frac{(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y})(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y})}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}|^3} \right) = \frac{1}{8\pi\eta} \left( \frac{\mathbf{I}}{r} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \mathbf{r}}{r^3} \right),
$$

where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor, $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}$ is the vector pointing from the point of force application to the point of observation, and $r = |\mathbf{r}|$ is the distance between these points.

Using the [[Oseen Tensor]], we can express the velocity field generated by a continuous distribution of forces $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y})$ as:

$$
\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}) = \int_{\mathcal{R}} \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) \cdot \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{y}) \, \mathrm{d}\mathbf{y}.
$$

This expression allows for the computation of velocity and pressure fields generated by arbitrary force distributions in an unbounded fluid. The [[Oseen Tensor]] is also used in the study of hydrodynamic interactions between particles, as it describes how the motion of one particle affects the motion of another through the fluid [[grahamMicrohydrodynamicsBrownianMotion2018]]. It also enables modeling microswimmers as a collection of force distributions. An important example of this is the model of the far-field induced by a microswimmer as a **force dipole** [[drescherFluidDynamicsNoise2011]], [[elgetiPhysicsMicroswimmersSingle2015]].

Since microswimmers are autonomous agents, the net force over the swimmer is zero. This means that the force dipole is the lowest order of the force distribution that can generate a net propulsion. A dipole field is generated by placing two [[Stokeslet]]s with equal magnitude $f$ but opposite direction forces, separated by a small distance $\mathbf{a}$, taking the limit as $\mathbf{a}$ becomes very small, and $f$ very large, while keeping the product between $f$ and $a$ finite. Mathematically, the velocity field $\mathbf{u}_d$ of a dipole at a point $\mathbf{x}$ can be derived as:

$$
\mathbf{u}_d(\mathbf{x}) = \lim_{\substack{a \to 0 \\ f \to \infty \\ \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{a} \to P}} \left[ \mathbf{u}_{\text{Stokeslet}}(\mathbf{r} - \frac{\mathbf{a}}{2}) - \mathbf{u}_{\text{Stokeslet}}(\mathbf{r} + \frac{\mathbf{a}}{2}) \right],
$$

where $P \equiv \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{a}$ is the dipole strength. The dipole velocity field can be found by taking the gradient of the [[Oseen Tensor]] and is given by:

$$
\mathbf{u}_d(\mathbf{r}, P) = \frac{P}{8\pi\eta r^2} \left[ 3 (\mathbf{e} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}})^2 - 1 \right] \hat{\mathbf{r}},
$$

where $\mathbf{e}$ is a unit vector indicating the orientation of the dipole, and the dependence on the dipole strength was explicitly written.

The dipole velocity field decays as $1/r^2$ with distance from the dipole, faster than the [[Stokeslet]] velocity field, which decays as $1/r$. The dipole velocity field has a characteristic `puller' or `pusher' pattern, depending on the sign of $P$, which represent the swimming mechanism of the microorganism. **Pullers** ($P < 0$), such as the algae *C. reinhardtii*, draw fluid in along their swimming axis and expel it perpendicular to the axis. **Pushers**, like most bacteria including *E. coli*, do the opposite.

This theoretical model has been tested experimentally by \citet{drescherFluidDynamicsNoise2011}. Using particle tracking techniques, they directly measured the flow fields around individual swimming *E. coli* bacteria, both in bulk fluid and near surfaces. Their results confirmed that the force dipole model accurately describes the bacterial flow field in the bulk for distances greater than about $6 \mu$m from the cell body, also confirming *E. coli's* pusher-type flow field, showing fluid being drawn in from the sides and expelled along the swimming axis. Close to the walls, the flow field is more complex due to the presence of hydrodynamic interactions which can be addressed by exploiting the [[Image Method]] [[marchetti2013Hydrodynamicssoftactivea]].
